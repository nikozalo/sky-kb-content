# Exploring Extensions: Probabilistic Logic and Pattern Matching

Whatever synlang's core becomes, it will likely need extensions for probabilistic reasoning and large-scale pattern matching. This document explores approaches — none are decided.

**This is research territory, not a roadmap.**

---

## Why Extensions Matter

The Synome will need capabilities beyond basic knowledge representation:

**Uncertainty is everywhere:**
- Risk assessments aren't certain
- Predictions have confidence levels
- Detection has false positive/negative rates

**Scale is massive:**
- Millions of agents
- Billions of relationships
- Finding patterns is computationally hard

How to address these needs is an open research question.

---

## Probabilistic Logic: The Problem

Classical logic deals in certainties: TRUE or FALSE.

Real knowledge is uncertain:
- "Counterparty X will probably default" (70%?)
- "This pattern suggests fraud" (with what confidence?)
- "The market will likely move" (how likely?)

Synlang needs to handle uncertainty somehow.

---

## Probabilistic Logic: Possible Approaches

### Probabilistic Logic Programming (ProbLog)

**What it is:** ProbLog extends Prolog with probabilistic facts and inference.

**Idea:** Facts have probabilities; inference computes probability of queries.

```prolog
% ProbLog-style
0.7 :: will_default(counterparty_x).
0.9 :: will_default(X) :- market_stress, high_exposure(X).

% Query: what's P(will_default(counterparty_x))?
```

**Advantages:**
- Well-studied, clean semantics
- Builds on Prolog foundations
- Tractable for many cases

**Limitations:**
- Scaling can be hard
- May not capture all uncertainty types
- Inference complexity

### Bayesian Networks

**Idea:** Directed graphical models with conditional probability tables.

**Advantages:**
- Well-understood inference
- Good tooling
- Handles dependencies explicitly

**Limitations:**
- Structure must be specified
- May not fit all knowledge structures
- Integration with hypergraphs unclear

### Markov Logic Networks

**Idea:** First-order logic + Markov networks. Weights on logical formulas.

**Advantages:**
- Combines logic and probability
- Handles relational data
- Flexible

**Limitations:**
- Inference can be expensive
- Weight learning is challenging
- Complexity

### Neural-Symbolic Hybrids

**Idea:** Use neural networks for uncertain reasoning, integrate with symbolic structures.

**Advantages:**
- Leverages modern ML
- Can learn from data
- Handles messy real-world patterns

**Limitations:**
- Less interpretable
- Integration challenges
- Active research area

### Other Approaches

- **Fuzzy logic**: Degrees of truth rather than probability
- **Dempster-Shafer**: Belief functions
- **Possibilistic logic**: Possibility vs probability
- **Custom**: Something new for this domain

**No clear winner.** Each has trade-offs.

## Pattern Matching at Scale: The Problem

The Synome will be huge. Finding patterns means:
- Searching massive hypergraphs
- Matching complex structures
- Doing it efficiently

Subgraph isomorphism (the core operation) is NP-complete. Naive approaches don't scale.

---

## Pattern Matching: Possible Approaches

### Index Structures

**Idea:** Pre-compute indexes to speed up common queries.

**Options:**
- Path indexes
- Subgraph fingerprints
- Bloom filters

**Trade-offs:**
- Storage vs query time
- Update cost vs query speed
- Which patterns to optimize for

### Query Optimization

**Idea:** Smart query planning, not just brute force.

**Options:**
- Cost-based optimization
- Adaptive execution
- Caching common patterns

**Trade-offs:**
- Optimizer complexity
- Workload assumptions
- Maintenance overhead

### Distributed Computation

**Idea:** Spread the work across many machines.

**Options:**
- Graph partitioning strategies
- Message-passing algorithms
- MapReduce-style aggregation

**Trade-offs:**
- Communication overhead
- Partition quality
- Failure handling

### Approximate Methods

**Idea:** Accept approximation for speed.

**Options:**
- Locality-sensitive hashing
- Sampling-based estimation
- Graph neural networks for similarity

**Trade-offs:**
- Accuracy vs speed
- When is approximation acceptable?
- Error bounds

**All approaches have limitations.** The right choice depends on use cases.

---

## The Integration Challenge

The hardest problem may be combining these:

**Probabilistic + Pattern Matching:**
- Find patterns AND assess their probability
- Update beliefs based on pattern matches
- Scale probabilistic inference over large graphs

This is cutting-edge research. No standard solutions exist.

---

## What We Don't Know

**For probabilistic logic:**
- Which approach fits synlang best?
- How to integrate with hypergraph structure?
- What performance is achievable?
- What's the right expressiveness/tractability trade-off?

**For pattern matching:**
- What patterns does the Synome actually need?
- What scale are we targeting?
- What accuracy is required?
- Which approaches work for hypergraphs specifically?

**For integration:**
- How do these interact?
- Can they share infrastructure?
- What's the user-facing interface?

---

## Research Directions

### Surveys Needed

- Probabilistic logic approaches comparison
- Hypergraph pattern matching algorithms
- ProbLog and related systems analysis
- Existing systems that combine these

### Prototypes Needed

- Small-scale probabilistic synlang
- Pattern matching benchmarks
- Integration experiments

### Questions to Answer

- What are the actual Synome use cases?
- What performance requirements exist?
- What's the minimum viable capability?

---

## How to Contribute

This area needs:

1. **Literature reviews** — What exists? What's been tried?
2. **Use case analysis** — What does the Synome actually need?
3. **Prototypes** — Small experiments with different approaches
4. **Benchmarks** — Testing on realistic data
5. **Discussion** — Exploring trade-offs and options

**No approach is favored.** We're trying to find the right answer, not advocate for one.
