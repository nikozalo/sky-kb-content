# Duration Model (Demand Side)

**Last Updated:** 2026-01-28

## Liability Duration Analysis (Demand Side)

### Purpose

Determine how much of the USDS liability base is short-term (could demand liquidity soon) versus long-term (sticky, unlikely to redeem).

### Method: Lindy Duration Model

For each lot of USDS:
1. Measure current age (time since last transfer)
2. Expected remaining holding time = current age × Lindy factor
3. Apply conservative haircut (e.g., 0.5x or 0.7x instead of 1x pure Lindy)

### Duration Bucket Structure

The Duration Bucket system uses a two-layer capacity calculation:
1. **Daily Lindy Measurement** — Dynamic calculation of liability duration distribution
2. **Structural Maximum Caps** — Governance-set upper limits per bucket, derived from empirical bank run research

#### Bucket Definitions

The system uses **101 buckets**, each representing **15 days**:

| Bucket | Duration | Bucket | Duration |
|--------|----------|--------|----------|
| 0 | 0 days | 50 | 750 days |
| 1 | 15 days | ... | ... |
| 2 | 30 days | 84 | 1,260 days (JAAA) |
| ... | ... | 100 | 1,500+ days |

**Bucket semantics:**
- **Liability side:** Bucket N contains liabilities with expected remaining duration ≥ N × 15 days
- **Asset side:** Bucket N is required for assets with SPTP (Stressed Pull-to-Par) in the range [(N-1) × 15, N × 15) days
- **Bucket 100:** Captures all liabilities with expected duration ≥ 1,500 days (the structural/permanent base)

#### Structural Maximum Caps: Double Exponential Model

The structural caps follow a **double exponential decay** model calibrated to empirical bank run data:

```
Individual Cap(t) = A × e^(-λ₁ × t) + B × e^(-λ₂ × t)
```

**Research-Calibrated Parameters:**

| Parameter | Value | Meaning |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| **A** | 10% | Hot money amplitude |
| **λ₁** | 0.35 | Hot money decay rate (half-life = 1.0 months) |
| **B** | 0.70% | Sticky money amplitude |
| **λ₂** | 0.0175 | Sticky money decay rate (half-life = 19.8 months) |

**Empirical Calibration Basis:**

The parameters were fitted to match the aggressive end of empirical bank run research:

| Horizon | Target | Empirical Basis |
|---------|--------|-----------------|
| 1 month | 75% | SVB lost 25% in 1 day, 87% over 2 days; First Republic lost 37% in 2 days |
| 3 months | 55% | First Republic: 57% gone by end Q1 2023; Credit Suisse: 29% deposits gone Q1 |
| 6 months | 45% | Credit Suisse: ~40% over 6 months |
| 12 months | 35% | NSFR implies 5-10% retail runoff/year, but 50%+ wholesale |
| 24 months | 25% | Beyond 1 year, only structural holders remain |
| 36 months | 15% | Deep Lindy territory |
| 50+ months | 10% | Structural/permanent base |

**Key Research Sources:**
- Basel III LCR/NSFR frameworks
- March 2023 bank runs: SVB, Signature Bank, First Republic, Credit Suisse
- MMF crisis data: September 2008 (26% in 2 weeks), March 2020 (30% in 2 weeks)
- ECB/Fed deposit behavior studies

**Reading the table:**
- **Individual:** Maximum % of portfolio that can be in this specific bucket alone
- **Cumulative:** Maximum % of portfolio that can be in this bucket OR higher (used for asset matching)
- **Bucket 100:** The 9.52% cumulative includes the tail beyond 1,500 days — the structural/permanent holder base

#### Key Checkpoints

| Horizon | Bucket | Cumulative | ~% Gone | Interpretation |
|---------|--------|------------|---------|----------------|
| **30 days** | 2 | 75.2% | 25% | Acute stress phase |
| **90 days** | 6 | 54.6% | 45% | Peak stress; nearly half gone |
| **180 days** | 12 | 44.8% | 55% | Post-acute; committed holders remain |
| **360 days** | 24 | 35.8% | 64% | Survived full stress cycle |
| **720 days** | 48 | 23.5% | 76% | Structural holders only |
| **1,080 days** | 72 | 15.5% | 85% | Deep Lindy territory |
| **1,260 days (JAAA)** | 84 | 12.6% | 87% | Duration capacity for CLO AAA |
| **1,500+ days** | 100 | 9.5% | 90% | Permanent/structural base |

*Note: These caps represent maximum allowable allocation even if Lindy measurement suggests higher capacity. Governance may adjust parameters based on observed USDS holder behavior.*

#### Two-Layer Capacity Calculation

**Layer 1: Daily Lindy Measurement**
Every day, measure USDS lot ages and calculate expected remaining duration to produce a "raw" liability distribution.

**Layer 2: Apply Structural Caps**
For each bucket from longest to shortest:
```
Raw Capacity = Lindy-measured liability amount for this bucket
Cap = Max Cap % × Total Portfolio

If Raw Capacity > Cap:
  Effective Capacity = Cap
  Overflow = Raw Capacity - Cap
  → Overflow trickles down to next-lower bucket
Else:
  Effective Capacity = Raw Capacity
```

**Example:**
- Total portfolio: $10B
- Lindy says bucket 48 (720 days) has $500M (5% of portfolio)
- Bucket 48 cap is 2% = $200M
- Result: Bucket 48 gets $200M, remaining $300M trickles to bucket 45 (675 days)
- If bucket 45 also exceeds its cap after adding overflow, it trickles further down

#### Conservative Rounding Rules

| Side | Rule | Rationale |
|------|------|-----------|
| **Liabilities** | Round DOWN to nearest bucket | A 40-day liability → bucket 2 (30 days). Conservative: assumes earlier redemption. |
| **Assets** | Round UP to nearest bucket | An asset with 1,250-day SPTP → bucket 84 (1,260 days). Conservative: requires longer-duration liabilities. |

#### Cumulative Capacity for Matching

An asset can match against its required bucket AND all higher buckets. Higher-tier capacity can always fulfill lower-tier requirements.

**Example:**
- An asset with 360-day SPTP requires bucket 24
- Available capacity = bucket 24 + bucket 30 + bucket 36 + ... + bucket 48 (cumulative)
- A 720-day liability can match a 360-day asset (but not vice versa)

```
Cumulative Capacity at Bucket N = Σ (Effective Capacity for all buckets ≥ N)
```

### Duration Capacity Reservation System

> **Note:** The tug-of-war mechanism and duration auctions described in this section are Phase 9+ features. Prior phases use manual, governance-directed duration matching allocations — see `accounting/tugofwar.md` for the algorithm details and phase dependencies.

Duration Bucket capacity is allocated to Primes through a reservation system. Primes acquire reservations via daily auctions, then can resell them on a secondary market.

#### Core Principles

1. **Own-bucket priority is emergent** — Primes tug at their own bucket with distance 0 (no decay), giving them natural priority without a separate allocation phase (see `../accounting/tugofwar.md`)
2. **All capacity allocated via tug-of-war** — When Lindy doesn't match reservations, the tug-of-war mechanism redistributes capacity to Primes with unmet need
3. **Full secondary market flexibility** — Time-sliced ownership, partial amounts, arbitrary durations

#### Daily Cycle

| Event | Frequency | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| Lindy measurement | Daily | Measure USDS lot ages, calculate liability duration distribution |
| Duration auctions | Daily | Auction unreserved capacity in each bucket |
| Tug-of-war | Daily | Allocate all capacity (own-bucket priority emergent from distance-0 tugging) |
| Settlement | Daily | Process deposits, redemptions, yield distribution |

#### Primary Auction

Auctions occur when unreserved capacity exists at a bucket. Primes bid price-per-epoch for capacity amounts. Highest bidders win. Winners receive reservations starting next epoch.

#### Secondary Market

Reservation holders can sell portions of their ownership with time-sliced schedules. Buyers can immediately resell, enabling complex ownership structures.

#### Capacity Allocation

All capacity is allocated through tugging — there's no special "own bucket first" phase. Primes tug at their own bucket with distance 0 (no decay), giving them natural priority there. But if their bucket is empty and a neighbor is full, they can still effectively tug nearby buckets.

**Phase 1: Tug-of-War**

All Primes tug for capacity simultaneously:
- Distance 0 (own bucket) = full tug strength, maximum effective value
- Distance N = tug decays by 0.9^N (floor at 10%)
- Tugging UP = effective value 1.0
- Tugging DOWN = effective value = target/your bucket
- Collisions resolved pro-rata
- Multiple rounds until all needs met or capacity exhausted

**Phase 2: Trading**

After needs are met, Primes can trade up:
- Tug at higher buckets with remaining excess
- Release lowest-value capacity downward
- Cascade until capacity finds a Prime that values it

**See `accounting/tugofwar.md` for full algorithm details.**

#### Capacity Duration Rules

| How Acquired | Duration You Get |
|--------------|------------------|
| From own bucket (distance 0) | Your bucket's duration (full match) |
| Tugged from higher bucket | Source bucket's duration (overkill but fine) |
| Tugged from lower bucket | Source bucket's duration (creates gap → gap capital required) |
